<p id="title">History Of The Dodo</p>

<p id="text">The first documented appearance of the dodo bird is in the early 15th century by Dutch explorers. Dutch vice-admiral Wybrand Van Warwijck used the name “walgyogel” in his journal to describe the bird after his visit to the island of Mauritius in 1598. The origins of word dodo to describe the bird is still unclear, but some ascribe it to the Dutch word dodoaars referring to the birds knot of feathers. Even though the Portuguese visited the island first in 1507, no records show of them mentioning the bird. But, according to the Portuguese dictionary, the word “dodo” is derived from doido meaning “fool” or “crazy”.</p>

<p id="text1">Because the dodo bird’s natural environment lacked any significant predators, dodos were fearless of people. This, combined with flightlessness, made them an easy prey. With combination of human hunting and becoming prey for animals brought onto the island by the explorers (i.e. dogs, cats, pigs, and rats) dodo birds became extinct in late 17th century.</p>
